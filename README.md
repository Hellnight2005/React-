## What is React?

React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast, scalable, and interactive user interfaces. It’s primarily used for creating single-page applications (SPAs) where the content changes dynamically without requiring a full page reload. React focuses on creating reusable components, making the code modular and easier to maintain.

### Key Features of React

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components, which are modular and reusable pieces of code that represent parts of the user interface.
2. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently manage updates. Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, React makes a virtual copy and syncs only the necessary changes, resulting in better performance.
3. **One-Way Data Binding**: React uses one-way data binding to ensure a predictable data flow. This means data flows from the parent to the child component, making the application easier to debug and manage.
4. **Declarative UI**: React enables developers to describe what the UI should look like based on the application’s current state. It then updates the UI automatically when the state changes.
